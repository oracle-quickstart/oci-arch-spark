# oci-quickstart-template
Packer is a tool provided by Hashicorp that allows you to automate creation of your machine images.
## Specifications
 * oci CLI v2.9.7 ([download](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/API/SDKDocs/cliinstall.htm#InstallingtheCLI))
 * packer v1.5.4  ([download](https://packer.io/intro/getting-started/install.html))
 
Click [here](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/API/SDKDocs/cliconfigure.htm) to learn more about how to configure your OCI CLI.
 
## Instructions
1. Clone the oci-quickstart-template repository:
```
$> git clone https://github.com/oracle-quickstart/oci-quickstart-template.git
$> cd oci-quickstart-template
```
2. Before we can build the image, we must create network components in our tenancy for the image to connect to. Log in to your tenancy and go to *Menu -> Networking -> Virtual Cloud Network -> Networking Quickstart*. [Follow the Networking Quickstart to create a network](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Tasks/quickstartnetworking.htm)

3. Fill in the ```env_vars.sh``` file with the appriopriate values from your tenanacy. [See below](#how-to-determine-environment-variables) for instructions on ways to obtain these values:
```
# Required for the OCI Provider
export PACKER_availibilty_domain=""
export PACKER_compartment_ocid=""
export PACKER_base_image_ocid="ocid1.image.oc1.iad.aaaaaaaa6tp7lhyrcokdtf7vrbmxyp2pctgg4uxvt4jz4vc47qoc2ec4anha"
export PACKER_image_name="Partner_Image"
export PACKER_shape="VM.Standard2.1"
export PACKER_ssh_username="opc"
export PACKER_subnet_ocid=""
export PACKER_type="oracle-oci"
```
4. Source the ```env_vars.sh``` file modified above, and then create the image:
```
$> source env_vars.sh
```

5. Validate the packer file:
```
$> packer validate template.json
Template validated successfully.
```

6. Create the image:
```
$> packer build template.json
[...]
==> Builds finished. The artifacts of successful builds are:
--> oracle-oci: An image was created: 'Partner_Image' (OCID: ocid1.image.oc1.iad.aaaaaaaak2howsh3wlwwlug4ut3erplh3b26i63ejpw2wxehd7gp5jod7xna) in region 'us-ashburn-1'
```

7. Done! Check you tenancy for the resulting image. Menu -> Compute -> Custom Images.

## How to Determine Environment Variables

![Cloud Shell](images/cloudshell.png)

Users will need to log into their tenancy to find the required information for setting the environment variables. One helpful tool is the Cloud Shell feature that can be accessed from the users tenancy homepage. By typing the commands below into the cloudshell terminal, users can get the required key/value pairs. The following direct link will open will the users tenency and open a Cloud Shell embedded terminal:
